File,Issue Type,Description,Severity,Recommendation
android/app/src/main/res/xml/file_paths.xml,Configuration Error (FileProvider),"The `FileProvider` is incorrectly configured. It uses `<external-path>` which refers to public external storage, but the application saves and intends to share files from its private internal storage (`Directory.Data`). This mismatch will cause `SecurityException` and crashes when other applications try to access shared file URIs.",Critical,"Replace `<external-path name=""my_images"" path="".""/>` with `<files-path name=""my_files"" path="".""/>` to correctly authorize access to the app's internal files directory for sharing."
android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml,Permission Misdeclaration (Legacy Storage),"The `AndroidManifest.xml` declares `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` and `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions, but the app targets `targetSdkVersion 35`. For API level 30 and above, these permissions are effectively ignored for broad external storage access due to Android's Scoped Storage model. While the `savePhoto` and `exportToPublicGallery` functions appear to use modern APIs (`Filesystem.writeFile` to `Directory.Data` and `@capacitor-community/media`), retaining these legacy permissions can be misleading and suggests a potential for future bugs if direct file path access to external storage is attempted elsewhere.",Medium,"Remove `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` and `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions from `AndroidManifest.xml` as they are not needed when using modern Scoped Storage-compatible APIs."
